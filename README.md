Game based on Harvards CS50 Game Development course
For running the game:
1. You need to have love2d downloaded, love2d.org/#download.
2. LÖVE can load a game in two ways:
 From a folder that contains a main.lua file.
 OR
 From a .love file that has a main.lua file in the top-most directory level (aka root)
3. The easiest way to run the game is to drag the folder onto either love.exe or a shortcut to love.exe. Remember to drag the folder containing main.lua, and not main.lua itself.
 You can also launch the game from the command line:
"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\games\mygame"
"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\games\packagedgame.love"

Hit Enter to start and space to move the bird upwards
